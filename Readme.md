### TIME COMPLEXITY

Time Complexity of an algorithm is the mathematical function that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input.

It tells us how the number of operations grows when the input size grows, not the actual seconds or milliseconds.

✅ Key points about TC:

Measured in Big-O notation (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n²), etc.).

Focuses on the rate of growth, ignoring constants and machine-specific details.

Helps compare the efficiency of algorithms independent of hardware.

In time complexity (TC), we talk about the number of operations (steps) an algorithm performs, not about actual seconds or milliseconds.
